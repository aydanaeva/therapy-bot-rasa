    text: Feeling overwhelmed is completely normal. A lot of people I know feel overwhelmed because they struggle with work/life balance. When I feel stressed, I usually take an evening completely off to Netflix & chill.  I just try not to make it hard on myself
  - text: Usually when I feel that way I try to start my day with a nice breakfast and just take things slowly
  - text: Your feelings are normal. Just try to take things slow.
